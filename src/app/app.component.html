      <h4>Inspiraci√≥n:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We present to you a project made in Angular with a peculiar architecture in which there are three
            sub-applications routed with LazyLoaded from a Core Application which. Each of these apps are independient
            but they can be routed and can be used in a shared environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The proposal is merely a monorepo punished for teams of developers or simply developers who want to have a
            strictly organized project in layers and levels according to the size of the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another advantage in this project is that all these applications may have different assets but all have
            the
            same dependencies and a single package.json.
          </li>
        </ul>
